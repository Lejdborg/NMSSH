# NMSSH

NMSSH is a clean, easy-to-use, test driven framework for iOS and OSX that wraps libssh2.

The framework was initially built for usage in [Kleio](http://9muses.se/kleio) â€“ a Mac OSX application that simplifies continuous deployment.

**Using libssh2 version:** `1.4.2`

## Usage

### Install the framework

* Build the framework and add it to your project. Consult the Wiki for detailed information about how to [build for OSX](https://github.com/Lejdborg/NMSSH/wiki/Build-and-use-in-your-OSX-project) or [build for iOS](https://github.com/Lejdborg/NMSSH/wiki/Build-and-use-in-your-iOS-project).
* Add `#include <NMSSH/NMSSH.h>` to your source file.

### Connect to a server

#### 1. Create a new session

    NMSSHSession *session = [NMSSHSession connectToHost:@"127.0.0.1:22"
                                           withUsername:@"user"];

    if ([session isConnected]) {
        NSLog(@"Successfully created a new session");
    }

#### 2.1. Authenticate by password

    [session authenticateByPassword:@"pass"];

#### 2.2. Or by public key

    // Explicitly set the public key that should be used...
    // Pass nil as password parameter for unprotected keys
    [session authenticateByPublicKey:@"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
                         andPassword:@"pass"];

#### 2.3. Or connect to a SSH agent

    [session connectToAgent];

#### 3. Check if authentication was successful

    if ([session isAuthorized]) {
        NSLog(@"Authentication succeeded");
    }

#### 4. Don't forget to disconnect

    [session disconnect];
    session = nil;

### Using Channels

#### Executing shell commands

    NSError *error = nil;
    NSString *response = [[session channel] execute:@"echo foo" error:&error];
    NSLog(@"Response: %@", response);

#### (Optianally) executing shell commands with pseudo terminal support

    [session channel].requestPty = YES;
    [session channel].ptyTerminalType = NMSSHChannelPtyTerminalVT102;
    
    NSError *error = nil;
    NSString *response = [channel execute:@"echo foo" error:&error];
    NSLog(@"Response: %@", response);
    
Supported terminal emulations include VT102, ANSI and a vanilla terminal.

#### SCP file transfer

The SCP API provides a simple way to upload or download files.

The `to:` parameter is flexible in that if you provide a directory, it will keep the same filename as in the from-parameter. But if you provide a complete file name you may name the transferred file anything you want.

#### Uploading files from your local computer

    BOOL success = [[session channel] uploadFile:@"~/my-local-file.txt" to:@"/var/www/"];

#### Downloading files from a server

    BOOL success = [[session channel] downloadFile:@"/var/www/my-remote-file.txt" to:@"~/"];

### SFTP

#### Connect to SFTP

    NMSFTP *sftp = [NMSFTP connectWithSession:session];

    if ([sftp isConnected]) {
        // do stuff...
    }

    [sftp disconnect];

#### Check if directory exists

    BOOL exists = [sftp directoryExistsAtPath:@"/var/www/"];

#### Create directory

    BOOL success = [sftp createDirectoryAtPath:@"/var/www/new-dir/"];

#### Delete directory

    BOOL success = [sftp removeDirectoryAtPath:@"/var/www/dir/"];

#### List contents of a directory

    NSArray *entries = [sftp contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:@"/var/www/"];

#### Check if file exists

    BOOL exists = [sftp fileExistsAtPath:@"/var/www/file.txt"];

#### Create symlink

    BOOL success = [sftp createSymbolicLinkAtPath:@"/var/www/symlink" withDestinationPath:@"/var/www/new-dir/"];

#### Read contents of file

    NSData *contents = [sftp contentsAtPath:@"/var/www/file.txt"];

#### Write to file

    NSData *contents = [@"Hello World" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    BOOL success = [sftp writeContents:contents toFileAtPath:@"/var/www/file.txt"];

#### Append contents to the end of a file

    NSData *contents = [@"\nBye!" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    BOOL success = [sftp appendContents:contents toFileAtPath:@"/var/www/file.txt"];

#### Delete file

    BOOL success = [sftp removeFileAtPath:@"/var/www/file.txt"];

#### Move file or directory

    BOOL success = [sftp moveItemAtPath:@"/var/www/file.txt" toPath:@"/var/www/newname.txt"];
